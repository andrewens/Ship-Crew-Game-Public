Github issue tracker / roadmap for Ship Crew Game RPG

## About the game
Ship Crew Game RPG is a sci-fi, multiplayer crew-based roleplaying quest game where you enlist with a starship crew and cross the galaxy to complete missions for your faction. 

You must hold on to your wits as you navigate strange new worlds full of monsters, criminals, and aliens on your quest for credits and status. Navigate a massive galaxy with your crew, selecting from hundreds of star systems and choose your destiny -- will you uphold the law and bring order to these worlds? Or will you abuse your power and prey on unsuspecting merchants and miners?

## Aesthetic Choices

These are philosophical choices/principles that give soul to the game. They are not propped by logic, but instead by intuition and taste.

**This game is for playing with groups of friends!!**

Similarly to private Minecraft servers, this game is best enjoyed with others you love. Make it easy to do so.

Integrating ROBLOX voice chat may be a bad compromise to people just using discord -- Discord is more conducive to this than talking to randos on the internet. Build this infrastructure in Discord, not ROBLOX.

**Appeal to Terraria/Stardew Valley/Starbound's Indie audience**

(By making this a 2d pixel art game)

Make people confused when they realize this is a ROBLOX game. Give people a reason to talk about it with their friends. Change people's perspective of ROBLOX as a platform. Give YouTubers clickbait video titles.

**Viscerally stark contrast between spaceship (home) and worlds. Yin/yang. Chaos/order. Routine/novelty.**

Something of a Hero's journey loop (@Joseph Campbell). The ship is safe (generally), the worlds are not. You leave the safety of your ship to gain a boon, and you return having changed.

Arguably, there are tiers to this effect -- there should be a central space station that is even safer than your ship. But being in your ship is safer than not. And also, the ship is part of the journey, which kind of pokes into the Hero's journey idea -- unless you define home as the space station.

**Physicalize items.**

Minecraft uses icons for inventory items that you can drop on the ground or manipulate in the inventory. Instead, I want items to have more weight. This introduces inconvenience, which may conflict with this goal.

**The game explains itself as you play. The game is easy to play.**

Design the UI/controls/game/etc such that you learn as you play, and the learning curve isn't too steep.

**People love expressing identity.**

The implications of this principle are:

* Giving players ways to express themselves ("roleplay") will lend itself to higher retention rates
* This is accomplished by: giving players jobs, obvious social status for being good at the game, cool but scarce/rare avatars, rare items only found in certain circumstances, actual control over other players(?) or at least NPCs
* Some of those things can be sold for profit :)

**People love to build homes**

**People are wired for survival in a group**

**You never feel like you know everything that's going to happen in the game.**
