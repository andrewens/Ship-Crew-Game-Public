## About the game
Ship Crew Game RPG is a sci-fi, multiplayer crew-based roleplaying quest game where you enlist with a starship crew and cross the galaxy to complete missions for your faction. 

You must hold on to your wits as you navigate strange new worlds full of monsters, criminals, and aliens on your quest for credits and status. Navigate a massive galaxy with your crew, selecting from hundreds of star systems and choose your destiny -- will you uphold the law and bring order to these worlds? Or will you abuse your power and prey on unsuspecting merchants and miners?
